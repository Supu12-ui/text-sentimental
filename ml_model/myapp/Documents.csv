80,1453,Mail in Ballot Issues,"I was a Poll Inspector on the City of Novi Absentee Ballot Counting Board for the 2020 General Election.  The scanners stop working early into the night.  We waited for the 8 pm mail delivery ballots to arrive.  We processed them for the tabulators.  The late arriving ballots were very few and quickly processed.  We signed the paperwork and waited around for a while.  We were released at 10 pm, since our part was done.  However, hundreds of ballots were still not tabulated at that time, with the tabulators still not functioning.  One of the Democrats at my table had a wife working the overseas copying table in the tabulation room, which the Poll Inspectors were not allowed into, except during break time to pick up our meal.  His daughter was one of the tabulation workers, who complained that she is an IT person and could get the tabulators working, but wasn't authorized to have access to the system.  This never occurred during the 2018 Primary or General Election, nor during the 2020 Primary.  And not at the Northville School District Special Election 2021.  The tabulators shutting down was an anomaly and hundreds, if not thousands, of ballots weren't tabulated until AFTER election day, in the wee hours of the morning.

182,3145,Mail in Ballot Issues,"My son has now grown and moved away from home to Colorado.  We received a postcard checking if he and we were still active voters. The instructions said to return the card to the post office if this person is no longer an active voter, so I returned his card to the post office.   Point #1-- This is essentially an opt *out* system, whereby absent, dead, or faux voters have to take action in order to be excluded from voter rolls. I found it annoying enough to be asked to drive my son's card to the post office, but this is *really* a lot to ask of the dead and non-existent voters!  So to continue ... after a while, my son received a 2nd mailing asking him to confirm again that he really wasn't an active voter here anymore by returning it to the post office.   Again I took it to the post office. Then a third mailing came, saying that the previous 2 attempts to reach him by mail had been returned, if this was in error then contact ××××. So I did nothing at this point since it was not an error.  Then...  When my husband and I received our mail ballots a few weeks later, so did my son!

461,4385,Polling Location Issues,"I signed up to be a senior poll monitor in Clark County,  NV. In person voting is done using the dominion ICX machine which is connected to a printer.  The main job of the poll monitor is to ensure that each voter's vote gets recorded into the usb card in the machine. The attached printer will print out the voter's choices,  but the printer output stays in the printer and the voter can look at it through a transparent panel in the printer.  The voter cannot take a copy of his or her votes with her.  The counting is not done at the precinct.  All the machines and the printers go back to the election center in Clark County and the counting is done at the center.  Although the USB data needs to match the data from the printers,  unless ordinary citizens from both parties, especially the MAGA wing of the republican party,  are allowed to participate in the counting process,  there is huge potential for cheating at the counting centers.  The main focus in Clark County NV and likely many other counties across the country needs to be in the counting process.  it needs to be a primary responsibility of citizens who participate in counting to make sure every vote is audited and matched with the printer outputs.",EBOApp.pdf,/pdf/EBOApp.pdf,1,NULL,NULL,9/27/2022 5:41,8/30/2023 18:05,3,1,0,Nevada,Clark,1

608,7303,Misc.Red Flags,"I met with the chairman of the GOP in Flagler County (Palm Coast/Flagler Beach, Florida) . It was an interview, he was testing me to see if he would even consider giving me any opportunity to be invited in.  I was very careful in what I said but he gave me a lot of insight on who they really are. It could be a lot worse but it’s not good. And they are very suspicious and skeptical of outsiders.    They are angry with Governor Desantis, they aren’t big fans of President Trump (they think they are too controversial and too far right), they hate Steve Bannon (they are very much aware of the precinct strategy and they are working very hard to not let MAGA or Steve Bannon people on the inside).   My father in law tells me they are corrupt here  He was very suspicious and skeptical at first, he emphasized how they are fighting to keep MAGA and Steve Bannon precinct people out.  They want establishment weak republicans.   He is inviting me to step in. I was very careful in how I spoke and listened to him very carefully. But he has invited me to multiple events already. It went very well so hopefully I can get in there but I must be very careful. I’m trying to become a precinct committeeman, but I must wait until December after the local precinct elections/votes. He is sending me the paperwork for the application and the oath.  I hope whoever takes leadership in December is farther right than these guys in charge right now but so far it’s looking not too good in this area and I must be very careful or else I’ll be blacklisted in Flagler County.  They are establishment weak RINOs it seems. Hopefully I get all the way in as a committeeman and hopefully new leadership is farther right and willing to fight harder.

634,7968,Polling Location Issues,"I was an election worker in Pinal County on the Midterm elections.  The location I worked had multiple issues in addition to running out of republicans ballots.  The workers were breaking rules, and were very sloppy with the end of day ballot counts.  The “Marshall” left the polling location to go to his polling place to vote because he hasn’t voted yet.  This was strictly against the rules.  Several of us told him not to do it, but he ignored us and went anyway.  Another lady was responsible for counting the total number of ballots received, and as she was quickly going through them she continuously counted them incorrectly.  I questioned her about it because I’d seen several counting errors.  She said it was close enough and refused to recount.  She was friends with 2 other of the ladies who were also working at the polls, and all day they were talking about how they were going out for drinks when they were done. They mentioned while the counting was going on they needed to hurry a so they could leave.  The one making the counting errors brought them over to me to certify, and I refused.  I told her I wasn’t going to certify them as correct because I knew they weren’t correct.  She stormed out with her friends.  The person running the polling location has never worked an election before, and was very meek, and wouldn’t do her job at all.  She basically shut down and kept going into the break room.  We were missing equipment and I kept asking her to find out where the missing equipment was, but she just sat down and started looking at a phone list and never made a call.  She didn’t Leah anything, and sat there while the others were working.  The Marshall was sitting right next to the ballot drop box and I told him the rules said nobody could be mean the box (I assume so there could be no monkey business).  He ignored me continued to sit next to the box.    It was so unorganized I couldn’t believe it.  The following day I sent an email to the lady who works directly under Virginia Ross, explaining the antics that were going on.  I went into great detail about how disturbed I was that the elections were basically a joke to the other poll workers.    She never responded.

The coordinator took all of the ballots out of a locked voting machine first thing in the morning and put them on table out in the open to make them in a neat pile. He then put them in a bag with a zipper. It was not clear if he locked this bag. He then put the bag in a corner of the room for the rest of the day. Anyone could have take it out the side door. Not secure at all! All the ballots were votes. Why were they taken out of the machine? They always had an excuse why they were doing things and blamed it on me being “new”. Not sure if this is normal, but definitely did not seem secure to take ballots out of the locked machine while people where voting. The coordinator would not give his full name, only “John P”. The two coordinators were very shady, and the “security” who came at the end of the night were equally shady. There were many incidents that seemed “off” at this polling location. The woman polling coordinator e even admitted to me that “the Italians” run elections in New York and play both sides. She seemed to be in on it too. Her name is Celeste Dibernardo…same last name as a famous mafia member. These things going on were mainly between the coordinators and one poll worker named Vera Powell who was hiding a blank ballot next to her the day before.

Information: In Smithtown election district 043, ballots which are read by computer  scanners are prepared by voters using specific black felt tip pens. In previous elections, ballpoint pen ink was rejected by electronic scanners.  Today, I observed that Smithtown Election District 043 made available two (2) types of pens in the ballot preparation areas: the aforementioned black felt pen provided by the election vendor, and in addition, ballpoint pens.   I inquired with election workers if ballpoint pens would be read correctly by the computer  scanning machines. Election workers replied that electronic ballot scanners can read ball point ink.  I did not challenge this assertion.  Please note that ballot scanner may have been re-calibrated for ballpoint ink since the last election. My concern, however, is that  ballots prepared with ball point ink may require “curing” later tonight.  I am concerned this may result in an election integrity issue.

951,9596,Mail in Ballot Issues,"I am a traveling registered nurse temporarily living in GA for work. I requested a ballot from PA, my home state where I’m registered to vote, for the primary ballots with no incident. I was still in GA for the 2022 general election so I requested a mail-in ballot sometime in September, but I can’t recall the exact date. I never received the request so I looked on the PA voting website to see if I could figure out why it was delayed. According to the website I did not have an approved mail-in ballot request, so I requested it again. That time I received the paper ballot request and I mailed it back on 10/21/2022 (I wrote the date down). By 11/4/2022 I still had not received my requested ballot, though the website said this time I did have an approved mail-in ballot request (which was received and approved on 10/27/22 according to their website, and I might add that date is before the 11/1/22 deadline to request a mail-in ballot request. This same website had a blank date box for when the ballot was mailed. At this point I spent $1300 on a roundup plane ticket to fly home to vote because that was the last day I would have been able to mail back my ballet (had I ever received it) and know it could possibly arrive at my locality by the deadline of 8pm on 11/8/22. I landed in my locality yesterday, 11/7/22, and just a few hours after I landed my husband (which is still in GA) sent a picture of the ballot that finally arrived. I’m glad I flew out because there was no way I could’ve gotten that ballot returned in time. In fact, I had no way to know it was even coming in the mail. I’m writing this because I’m hearing some rumors that these same issues are happening in battleground states and it all seems very suspicious to me and I would love for it to be investigated.

987,9798,Voter Suppression Issues,"Dear VotifyNow.org, My wife and I voted in person this morning. The sign-in computer screen was positioned vertically making it difficult to position myself to sign my name. In addition, there was no stylus or pen available to use for writing my signature. Using my finger or fingernail was extremely awkward and the screen did not capture a signature that in any way resembles my actual signature. In addition, there were numerous skips as I tried to sign with my finger. I tried 3 times and finally settled for a totally distorted signature. It is my opinion that any attempt to verify signatures using this method will be completely unreliable. I voted at the Cactus High School site. In addition, the machine trying to accept the ballots was rejecting several of them, and I heard on the radio that this was happening for 10-20% of the ballots. I used a fine-point blue ink Sharpie and noticed that many of my circles bled through to the back. The person in charge told me that the machines were setup to take that into consideration.

They only had blank paper ballots that were wrapped in plastic which shows me that no one else was requesting them. Husband and I did not want to use their Dominion machines. We had the same issue during primaries in March. Today, we ended up filling out our mail-in ballots instead which we really didn’t want to do, but we figured they’d be less likely to go through adjudication. When we walked in, we very specifically told the poll workers that we did not want to use the Dominion machines and that we wanted preprinted paper ballots. Husband and I were both checked in and given papers for Dominion machines after checking in. We stopped, didn’t sign/confirm on their iPad and repeated that we didn’t want to use the machines. I reminded the poll workers that we told them ahead of time that we didn’t want the machines and asked if this would prompt our votes to go into adjudication.

1059,9972,Misc. Red Flags,"Votify Now, I do not use my real name online. If you reach out, contact me via email. Once Im comfortable, Ill share my name.   I've seen behind the curtain as a Primary Poll Judge that worked a precint out of Denton County Texas for 2022. The entire voting system is broken. The incompetence I witnessed is jaw dropping. I'm a Satellite Communications Engineer, so technology & the management of complex systems & projects is my expertise. The person administrating poll judges & poll workers for Denton Co. is incompetent. Most of the people administrating the Denton County elections are completely incompetent. I believe this is the ultimate goal. The system & procedures to open & close polls are overly complex & burdensome, only to display fake security procedures that might make a non technical individual comfortable, but would horrify a person like me The poll workers could count individual ballots faster than administrating these overly complex ES&S systems & procedures. The burdensome procedures and systen complexity are leaving us with these compromised systems. The poll pads and ballot printers are connteded to a new AT&T MiFi Hotspot. The Pollpads employ minimal security & do now use VPN when posting voter status to a public facing website:  https://www.votedenton.gov/elections-administration-live-camera-feed/. Why is it that the state needs to know whether you voted during any election or before polls close? This is another security hole. If I were a bad guy, I could easily corrupt an entire precinct. As a judge, I am responsible for the hiring of all poll workers for my precint. All I need is a handful of good friends & that precinct is mine. I could stuff that ballot box throughput the election. The Poll Judge is responsible for the transportation of those ballots to a central tabulation center. A member of the opposite party was not present. This is where I wanted to puke. The ballots are handed off to a team of retards (figuratively stupid mofos for you woke losers) that are responsible for posting the results for the election you just worked. WHY? The poll judge is forbidden from touching a ballot. WHY? I & the alternate Judge knows what took place & can easily fix something if there is a mistake. That third person has no idea what happened at that precinct. I voiced a complaint with the elections administration office, asking why someone else is posting my totals from my precint? I asked to be part of the final count, but was told those positions are already filled. This ticked me off, because I was witnessing another hole in securing those ballots & counts. I raised my voice about security concerns & told them this is a procedure that must be changed. I told them it should be the responsibility of the Primary & opposing party Alternate Poll Judges that post those results. The election office said that they like the idea & would be bringing it up with the election board. The delivery of those ballots should be under police escort with a member from the opposite party.    At the central tabulation center, there should be both a Republican & Democrat representative checking in your results, but that is not what I witnessed. It looked like a lot of college students, but I think that's by design as the central tabulation center is down the road from UNT. These kids are looking for a quick buck & most lean left.   THE ELECTION SYSTEM IS BROKEN. GO TO PAPER WATERMARKED PROPRIETARY BALLOTS THAT ARE HANDCOUNTED LIVE UNDER A FORENSIC CAMERA WITH A PROPRIETARY PAPER FEADER AT EACH PRECINT. THE VOTER MAKES THEIR SELECTION ON THAT PAPER, THEN DROPS IT INTO A SEALED BALLOT BOX. AFTER 7PM, THE VOTER CAN WATCH A LIVE FEED AS THE BALLOTS ARE BEING COUNTED UNDER A FORENSIC CAMERA. THE STATE COULD OFFER AN APP THAT DISPLAYS THE VOTERS BALLOT & COUNT FOR THAT ELECTION INCREMENTING 1 VOTE HIGHER FOR THE CANDIDATES SELECTED. THE END USER IS HANDED A RECEIPT WITH A QR CODE TO WITNESS THAT INTERACTION LIVE. DO AWAY WITH EARLY VOTING & CENTRAL TABULATION CENTERS. THOSE CENTERS COULD BE RE-PURPOSED TO STORE THOSE FORENSIC CAMERAS/FEEDERS & ELECTION PROPS. MAKE VOTING A TWO DAY FEDERAL HOLIDAY. PASS A LAW THAT REQUIRES AN EMPLOYEER TO GIVE YOU THE DAY OFF FOR ONE OF THOSE DAYS. THIS WOULD LEAVE THE SMALEST OF IMPACT TO BUSINESSES & LEAVE NO EXCUSE FOR THE VOTER. BAN MAIL IN BALLOTS. ONLY ALLOW A PROVISIONAL BALLOTS FOR THOSE EXCUSED BY THEIR DOCTOR. PASS A LAW FORBIDDING MEDICAL FRAUD TO CIRCUMVENT ELECTIONS (LOSS OF MEDICAL LICENSE).

My concern is specifically with the four cameras in the ballot handling room where they are separating the ballots from their envelopes. All of the tables closest to the view of the cameras have been vacant for the past hour....everyone is smashed together in the center of the room so the cameras can't really get a clear visual for anything that may be of concern.

1065,9994,Voter Suppression Issues,"Hello.   I am wondering what else to do.   In early October I received my ballot in the mail.   I filled out my ballot and turned it in to City Hall in Chandler where the poll worker asked to see the signature before my wife dropped my ballot off with hers on Thursday, November 3, 2022.   On Friday, my wife checked to see if my ballot had been counted. She found that my account said that was registered but inactive and I needed to call in to verify my address.   I had voted without incident in the primaries at this same address.   On Monday, November 7, 2022 I checked and the account said the same thing. I then called the number listed online.   I explained my situation. I told the woman I spoke to that I wanted to be sure my vote counted. She told me that someone had already called in to talk to the supervisor. I assured her that I have never called in and I was calling now to be sure my vote counted. She told me that if I got the ballot in the mail, it was in my name, and I turned it in, my vote would be counted.   I asked her how I was to get verification. She took my phone number and said that a supervisor would return my call. I did not get a phone call.   Today when attempting to log into my account, I got a notification that there is no one registered with that information.   At this point I have concern that my vote didn’t count and how many other people are in this situation    I don’t know what to do to make this known. This is not right!

1066,9996,Polling Location Issues,"Last night, I voted in-person. The machine I used changed at least one of my votes. After completing the electeonic ballot, I verified everything was correct on the tablet and then selected ""Print ballot"". After printing, I saw that the paper was misaligned, hiding the actual votes cast for House, Senate, school board, etc., allowing me to view only the judge retention section and my vote for an amendment to the Utah Constitution. On my electronic ballot, it correctly displayed that I voted AGAINST the amendment. The printout showed that my vote had changed to FOR regarding the amendment.  I rejected my ballot and went the process again, selecting the same candidates, judge retention, and again voting AGAINST the amendment. I selected ""Print Ballot"" and once again, the top portion of my printout was not visible and my vote AGAINST the amendment had been changed to FOR.  I alerted a nearby election official who went to the hall to make a phone call. She returned roughly 10 minutes later and asked me to move to a different machine. She turned the machine around that I had originally used, so as to prevent further use. She let me know that deputies would come to remove the machine and begin an investigation. The machine that I had used displayed that 41 ballots had previously been cast by that machine.  The new machine worked well. My printout was visible and reflected the choices I had made electronically.  Today, I called the County Clerk and spoke with a man named Ron Buckley. He informed me that he had no knowledge of that particular machine having any issue, but that 1% of their machines from their 40 locations would be audited over the next two weeks. I don't know exactly how many machines there are, but based on the 12-14 I saw at my voting location, I'd estimate 500-600, meaning only 5 or 6 machines would be audited. I was informed that there is no way to tell whether my original machine would be audited. This concerns me as there were 41 ballots cast prior to mine. Who knows what was changed on their ballots? It happened twice to me on the same machine, so I'm betting there's a good chance it happened to those other 41.",Wed Nov 09 18_16_12 MST 2022.jpg,/pdf/Wed Nov 09 18_16_12 MST 2022.jpg,1,40.6971525,-112.044563,11/10/2022 1:23,8/26/2023 5:28,4,1,0,Utah,Salt Lake,1

He also went to the Dominion machine and look at something.

I then signed the registry, and the lady handed me a blank ballot. As I asked her how I feed it into the machine that she pointed out across the room, she called out another lady's name to help show me, who then led me to the machine and showed me where to feed it to the machine. I fed it in and thanked her. As all of the candidates popped up, she then said to make my  selections, while standing there watching me. Well, I did, while feeling violated, but thinking she's just some misfit lady who doesn't know that voting is a private choice. After completing my 6 choices, she directed over to the tabulator machine and showed me how to feed that. Now, I've  voted before at this polling place, and knew how to do all of this, as the machines also instruct you with visual slides. I was just momentarily confused before getting 'assisted'. So after feeding the tabulator, another 'misfit' lady handed me an ""I voted"" sticker. Then, as I left, my 'assistor' immediately went into another room behind the tabulator...knowing exactly who all of my votes went to and possibly used this info for later shenanigans.

1092,8178,Polling Location Issues,"From Bill Gillcrest - Town of Sweden Supervisor: A letter to the MC Board of Elections from the Sweden Town Supervisor. From the Sweden Town Supervisor:   I have heard from many of you as well as our Town staff about issues with the manner in which the Monroe County Board of Elections ran the election process here in Sweden yesterday.  I have reached out to the Board of Elections to express our frustrations, as well as to our legislators to ask for their help in resolving these issues so our residents are better served in the next election.  Here is an excerpt from an email I sent to the BOE earlier today:    ""I need to be frank with you about this year's election process here in Sweden.  The manner in which the election was handled here was frustrating, embarrassing and not in the best interest of those who should be served in the election process: the voters.  The Community Center voting operation ran out of ballots in the evening (during a rush) and I have thus far been contacted by several residents wondering why they were not allowed to vote, and accusing Sweden (though we don't have any role in administering elections) of engaging in some grand conspiracy to ""steal the vote"".  Second, the SUNY polling place frustrated many of our residents who were forced to go there to vote for the first time.  It was not well publicized, unexpected and it is not a good or accessible location for a polling place.  I heard directly from several residents that did not know where to go, and they felt overwhelmed with trying to navigate their way to a place (really, any place) on the SUNY campus.  Plus, the distance from the parking lot to the polling place presented a significant impediment to voting, particularly for those voters with disabilities.  Again, I heard from several voters who were impeded by the distance they had to walk/traverse, plus the length of the ramp that must be surmounted in order to reach the polling place.  I understand that college students need to have access to polling places, but to disrupt the normal and long-established voting locations and patterns of taxpayers and year-round residents of our community in this way is a travesty.  Aren't students typically the youngest and most able-bodied among us?  This is not in the best interest of our residents.  Can you please provide me with the number of SUNY students who actually voted yesterday?  If you can identify them for the purpose of figuring out if SUNY Brockport meets the 300 person threshold set by the new law, I would think you should be able to tell me how many of the students actually voted.  I also need to know why SUNY Brockport was the only campus in our county that qualified to have a polling place.  How is it possible that the larger colleges and universities in Monroe County do not have 300 registered voters on campus?  Finally, the election workers who staffed our Town Hall left a complete mess for us to deal with.  They did not re-assemble the courtroom, and thankfully the judges did not have court this morning, as they usually do on Wednesdays.  None of the court furniture was replaced, and the room was left in disarray.  What ever happened to the motto of ""leave it better than you found it?""  The workers should have restored the room to the condition it was in when they found it.  It is not right or fair to use our space, and then leave all the restoration work to us.""

I spoiled my ballot and voted in-person. there were not any tabulstors onsite so had to put into box 3. I check if my ballot has been received on pima county recorder site n it says I did not request a ballot n does not indicate that my vote was counted. it seems that if you take name off mailing list and they send you a ballot anyway you are in no'-mans land. if I sent it back thru mail it would have never existed n if I go for in-person it still doesn't get counted. I checked in at polling site but still not get vote counted.,pdf,/pdf/pdf,1,32.181661,-110.8565027,11/12/2022 21:50,8/25/2023 22:03,4,1,0,Arizona,Pima,1

About 45 minutes later, I went back out in the lobby area where these were.  I then saw the stack had increased substantially.  Now about 25 papers were there.  I reported these photos as well.  Why and how was the stack replenished?  The Polls had closed by this time.  I showed them to the Poll Manager, Ola Kayyali.  She said she would tell the Roswell Library librarian in the morning to get rid of these.  She would also tell the other precincts of this illegal behavior.

1453,12480,Polling Location Issues,"This report was written by Steven Kramer my husband.     I went to vote in the PPP at 9:10 AM today, 02/19/2024 at Spruill Oaks Library. I was the first voter for the PPP period there and the only one in the voting location at the time. The person at the poll pad signed me in and then flipped the screen for me to pick my party and sign. However, the orientation of the screen did not flip so I had to do everything upside down. They ultimately fixed that.    The larger concern is that the data card was not recognized by the poll pad. They tried several times, with several data cards, flipping the several cards on both sides, even removing the stabilizing attachment to the card writer. Still no luck. They told me to go to another person, another poll pad. I repeated the above sequence (with a good orientation flip of the screen this time) and, still, the data card could not be read on the new device. In both cases, it wasn't just that the card couldn't be programmed, the card wasn't even recognized as being inserted.    So, having spent all the time at the polling place I could, as I had a doctor's appointment coming up, I left without voting.    Then, leaving the Spruill Oaks Library parking lot, major construction was being done on Spruill Rd and Old Alabama Rd (where the library is on the corner of each). It was dangerous to enter Old Alabama, in the middle of flagmen on both sides letting people in. Why, when there was no construction for months at this location (a right turn lane was going to be put in, but construction was idle for months, did they decide to start it up when the PPP began? Whether or not intentional, it was a hardship to get to and leave the polling location.    Later, at noon, when I returned from my appointments, coming on Old Alabama, they wouldn't let me turn left onto Spruill Rd to try to vote again. So, again I was thwarted in trying to vote. I ended up not voting today, after 2 trips to the polling location.",NULL,NULL,1,34.0141183,-84.2243393,2/19/2024 21:44,2/20/2024 1:16,5,1,0,Georgia,Fulton,1
